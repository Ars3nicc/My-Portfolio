# Personalized e-Portfolio Website

### Created in 2022 by Franz Manrique
Developed purposely for displaying and showcasing the author's profile, details, and working projects. The portfolio website is used solely for professional purposes such as **portfolios** and **job applications**. No particular frameworks and other backend features included. Just pure HTML and simple designs. Enjoy viewing!
